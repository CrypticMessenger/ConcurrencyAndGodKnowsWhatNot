| `basic_neural_net.py` | Demonstrates a basic neural network with one hidden layer, implemented from scratch in Python using NumPy. It includes both forward and backward propagation (training). |
| `convolution/`        | A Java project demonstrating 2D convolution with various concurrency models (naive, multi-threaded, thread-pooled). It's a mix of concepts from "Java Concurrency in Practice" and "Programming Massively Parallel Processors", and includes benchmarking for performance analysis. |
