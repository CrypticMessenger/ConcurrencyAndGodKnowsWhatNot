| `basic_neural_net.py` | Demonstrates a basic neural network with one hidden layer, implemented from scratch in Python using NumPy. It includes both forward and backward propagation (training). |
| `convolution.cpp`     | Shows a 2D convolution operation on a matrix, written in C++. It includes padding, and it's parallelized using OpenMP. It also profiles execution time and memory usage. |
